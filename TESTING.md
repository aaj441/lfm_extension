# Testing Guide for Last.fm Recommender

## Quick Start - Running the App

### Method 1: Python Server (Recommended)

1. Open a terminal in the project directory
2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python3 server.py
   ```
3. Open your browser to: `http://localhost:8000`
4. Open the browser console (F12) to see debug logs

### Method 2: Direct File Open (May have CORS issues)

- Simply open `index.html` in your browser
- If you see errors, use Method 1 instead

## Testing the App

### Step 1: Connect to Last.fm

Try one of these demo usernames:
- `rj` - Last.fm founder, lots of scrobbles
- `bahnhof` - Active user with diverse taste
- Or use your own Last.fm username!

**What to expect:**
- Click "Connect"
- You should see "Connecting to Last.fm..." in the console
- The app will fetch your recent tracks
- Console will show API calls and responses

### Step 2: Check Now Playing

**What to expect:**
- You should see your most recent track displayed
- Track name, artist, album, and artwork should appear
- Check browser console for "Current track:" log

**If nothing appears:**
- Open browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
- Look for error messages
- Common issues:
  - User has no scrobbles
  - API rate limit reached
  - CORS errors (use Python server instead)

### Step 3: Check Recommendations

**What to expect:**
- 5 recommendations should appear below the now playing track
- Each shows: track name, artist, album art, and similarity match %
- Pass (‚úï) and Like (‚ô•) buttons on each

**Console logs to check:**
- "Generating recommendations for: [Artist]"
- "Found X similar artists"
- "Generated X recommendations"

### Step 4: Interact with Recommendations

**Test Pass button:**
1. Click ‚úï on a recommendation
2. That recommendation should disappear
3. "Passed" counter should increase
4. Console shows the action

**Test Like button:**
1. Click ‚ô• on a recommendation
2. That recommendation should disappear
3. "Liked" and "Discovered" counters should increase
4. Console logs the liked track

### Step 5: Test Pagination

**What to expect:**
- If you have more than 5 recommendations, pagination appears
- Click ‚Üí to go to next page
- Click ‚Üê to go to previous page
- Page indicator shows "Page X of Y"

### Step 6: Test Refresh

1. Click the üîÑ button
2. App should fetch your latest track
3. New recommendations should generate
4. Watch console for API calls

## Debugging Common Issues

### Issue: Nothing loads after clicking Connect

**Check:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for error messages
3. Check network tab for failed API calls

**Possible causes:**
- Invalid username
- API key issues
- Network connectivity
- CORS (use Python server)

### Issue: "No similar artists found"

**Possible causes:**
- Artist is very obscure
- Artist name has special characters
- Try clicking refresh for a different track

### Issue: Images not loading

**What to check:**
- Some tracks don't have artwork
- This is normal - a placeholder will show
- Check console for image URLs

### Issue: Recommendations not showing

**What to check:**
1. Browser console for errors
2. Network tab for failed API calls
3. Try a different username or refresh

**Debug logs to look for:**
```
API Call: artist.getSimilar
Similar artists response: {...}
Found X similar artists
Loading recommended tracks...
Generated X recommendations
```

## Console Commands for Debugging

Open browser console and try:

```javascript
// Check if app is loaded
console.log('App loaded:', typeof LastFmRecommender !== 'undefined');

// Get localStorage data
console.log('Username:', localStorage.getItem('lfm_username'));
console.log('Stats:', localStorage.getItem('lfm_stats'));

// Clear localStorage and reload
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

## Expected API Flow

1. **Connect:** `user.getInfo` ‚Üí validates username
2. **Now Playing:** `user.getRecentTracks` ‚Üí gets latest track
3. **Similar Artists:** `artist.getSimilar` ‚Üí finds related artists
4. **Top Tracks:** `artist.getTopTracks` (for each similar artist) ‚Üí builds recommendations

## Performance Notes

- Initial load: 5-10 seconds (fetching similar artists + tracks)
- Each recommendation fetch has a 100ms delay to avoid rate limiting
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds for now playing

## Mobile Testing

### On iOS:
1. Start Python server: `python3 server.py`
2. Get your computer's local IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
3. On iPhone, open Safari
4. Go to: `http://192.168.1.100:8000`
5. Add to Home Screen for PWA experience

### On Android:
1. Start Python server
2. Get your computer's local IP
3. On Android, open Chrome
4. Go to: `http://[your-ip]:8000`
5. Menu ‚Üí Add to Home screen

## Success Criteria

A working prototype should:
- ‚úÖ Connect with a Last.fm username
- ‚úÖ Display current/recent track with artwork
- ‚úÖ Show 5 recommendations based on similar artists
- ‚úÖ Allow pass/like interactions
- ‚úÖ Show match percentages
- ‚úÖ Support pagination
